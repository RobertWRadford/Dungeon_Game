# Dungeon_Game

This is an incomplete project, and is wrought with a plethora of issues in both game-balance and coding, but was built as I first learned Python as a language looking things up as I went and is also technically my first game I ever coded out. I also made this with a set in place restriction that all I could look up, import, and reference was core language methods/tools, as an example I could look up how to use enumerate in Python but not look up guides for specific tasks such as getting monsters to hunt a player through a maze with something like the aStar method, so I had to be creative and make my own methodology. It's far from good but I'm proud of it in a number of ways regardless and hope to find the time to come back and compelte it / recreate it in a more enjoyable playstyle.

The most up to date version of the game is the file labeled "DG_LaunchUI_V2.0" in the versions list. You can technically get to the end of the game geographically in the non-UI 5.5 file that plays strictly out of terminal, but it reuses the same combats throughout. Meanwhile the 2.0 with UI version is fully developed to the point you can reach but doesn't make it out of the second area.
